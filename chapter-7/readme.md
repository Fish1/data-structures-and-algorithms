# Notes Chpater 7

Multiple datasets

if we are iterating and combining two different data sets, we cannot say O(N^2)

This is because the two datasets are not the same size

We need O(N*M)

O(N*M) is a range between O(N) and O(N^2)

## Combinations

For example a password cracker will be every combination of letters

We have 26 letters and N number of chatacters in our password.

So a password with 3 characters will take 26^3 checks

As N increases we get O(26^N)

O(2^N) is the opposite of O(log(n))

For every value we add, the alogithm doubles the number of steps required.
