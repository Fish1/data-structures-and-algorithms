# Chapter 4 Notes

We can use big O notation to disover if an alogirthm is slow.

We can then use that information to decide if we should swap to a different algorithm, that has a better performance.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is considered a very easy sorting algorithm to implement. 

But it's performance has a lot to be desired.

In the worst case when the array is backwards it takes O(N^2) steps to complete the sort.

### O(N^2)

O(N^2) is considered inefficient, as the runtime of the algorithm grows exponentially as the set of data grow.

It tends to be the case that O(N^2) algorithms have loops inside loops.
