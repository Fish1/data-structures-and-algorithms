# Notes Chapter 9

## Stack

Add to the top of a stack, remove from the top of the stack. We cannot add or remove from the middle/bottom.

Stacks probably are not used for long term data. They are usually used for implementing algorithms.

They are an array, just with some restrictions on how to access/alter the data.
