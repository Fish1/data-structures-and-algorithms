# Notes Chapter 15

## Trees

Ordered arrays are good at lookup. But slow for insertion. We need to reorder the array every time we insert data into it, to verify that it is infact sorted.

Trees have nodes, but those nodes are able to point to multiple other nodes.

The first node is refered to as the root node.

The root node is a "parent" to the nodes it points too.

A "balanced" tree is when each sub tree has the same number of nodes.

## Binary Search Tree

Each node has two nodes.

The left node is less than the current, and the right node is greater than.
